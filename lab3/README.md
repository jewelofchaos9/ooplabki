##Binary long arithmetics 

You can call 3 type of constructors:  
1) Empty -- 0 in binary;  
2) Long -- it translates to binary string  
3) Binary string   

You can add every binary by + (Bin1 + Bin2)  

**IMPORTANT FEATURE**  
If you increase negative number (Bin++) it will be increased by mod!  
for example: -5++ = -6
